      <p>
      Rhyno EV is solving the commercial mobility needs with Made-In-India eScooter â€“ 
      a simplified, ergonomically optimized and carefully engineered Electric Special Utility Vehicle (SUV).

      Inspired by rhino, the company designs expressly in answer to the need for a 
      durable, high caliber, hi speed electric scooter. We are changing the decades 
      old two-wheeler design with a totally new approach which provides safety, durability,
      and plenty of utility options.

      At Rhyno, we believe there is a better way to express ourselves, hence, we are 
      committed to provide our customers a variety of choices and customizations.
